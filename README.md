You can use the notebook at https://colab.research.google.com/

Also added a Notebook for Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/) because they provide free weekly gpu and tpu hours and have more reliable TPU availability for free. TPUs are much faster than GPUs as they are designed for the purpose of Deep Learning. The Kaggle version uses pytorch.
